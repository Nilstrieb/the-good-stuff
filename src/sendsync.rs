// Oh no, we have a data race. This is not exactly good, in fact it's really bad.

// We need some kind of "this can be sent to other threads" trait. Let's call it "Send".

// It's an auto trait because we really don't want everyone having to implement this manually.
// It's also unsafe because the safety of our spawn function relies on it.

// Why exactly was Rc able to trigger a data race here? The key lies in interior mutability.
// Interior mutability like Cells but also raw pointers should therefore be forbidden by default.

// on the impl.

// The example above fails to compile. But there is no unsoundness here, we want to allow this.
// But as we've seen above, we cannot make `Cell: Send`.

// Really, we have two concepts at play here
// - Something that we can send owned top a thread.
// - Something that we can send a reference of to another thread
// Rc can support neither of those, as its possibly unsoundness (clone) can be triggered just
// with a shared reference to it, but also with an owned Rc because two owned Rcs can point to the same memory.
// Cell is different. Having a &Cell across threads can lead to the data race. But having an owned Cell cannot
// trigger the unsoundness, as it will just mutate the local value.

// Let's add a new trait for types that support being shared behind a reference.

pub unsafe auto trait Sync {}

// UnsafeCell is the key here and will make sure that types like Cell are !Sync.
impl<T> !Sync for UnsafeCell<T> {}

// Also forbid pointers to make sure that unsafe datastructures have to manually assert syncness.
impl<T> !Sync for *const T {}
impl<T> !Sync for *mut T {}

// Now we can actually implement Send for UnsafeCell again. Sending a Cell-like type to another thread
// is not problematic, only sharing it is.
// -impl<T> !Send for UnsafeCell<T> {}

// Now we just need one last piece, the interactions of Send and Sync.
// Sync means that we can share a reference across a thread, so let's represent that in an impl.
unsafe impl<T: Sync> Send for &T {}

// The same "reference like behavior" applies to Arc. We are only allowed to Send an Arc to another thread
// if the thing it holds is Sync. Arc<Cell<u8>> is therefore not Send, as this type is not thread-safe.
// unsafe impl<T: Sync> Send for Arc<T> {}

// In general, anything that provides shared access to T needs a T: Sync bound on its Send impl.

// Bonus: The cursed impl of magic_unchecked_spawn_for_our_convenience.
